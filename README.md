# DOM-Array-Methods
This project teaches high-order array methods and DOM manipulation. It fetches random users from the randomuser.me API and displays their wealth. It uses forEach() to render data, map() to double wealth, filter() to show only millionaires, sort() to order by wealth, and reduce() to calculate total wealth.
